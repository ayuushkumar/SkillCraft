Task-1
# 🍔 Food-Related Insights (Data Visualization with Matplotlib)

This project provides a set of **visualizations about fast food chains, calorie availability, and daily consumption habits** using Python and Matplotlib.  
The code demonstrates how to create multiple charts in a single figure using a 2x2 grid layout.

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

1. **Global Fast-Food Chains (by Outlet Count)**  
   Shows the number of worldwide outlets for McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway, and KFC (real approximations).  

2. **Favorite Fast-Food Chains (Survey Example)**  
   A hypothetical survey showcasing people’s favorite fast-food brands.  

3. **Daily Calorie Availability by Region**  
   Compares high-income countries with low-income countries (e.g., Nigeria).  

4. **Personal Daily Calorie Consumption (Histogram)**  
   Displays a sample distribution of individual daily calorie intake.  

---

## 🖼️ Example Output

The script generates a **2x2 grid of charts** like this:

- Top-left: Fast-food outlet counts  
- Top-right: Favorite fast-food survey results  
- Bottom-left: Daily calorie availability by region  
- Bottom-right: Histogram of personal calorie consumption

Task-2
# 📊 Titanic Survival Prediction – Data Visualization Project

A hands-on project exploring the **Titanic dataset** using **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**.  
The goal was to clean, analyze, and visualize the data to uncover survival patterns and better understand the factors that influenced passenger survival.

---

## 🔎 Project Highlights
- ✅ Cleaned and pre-processed missing data efficiently.  
- 📈 Visualized survival trends based on **gender, passenger class, and age**.  
- 🌡️ Built an interactive **correlation heatmap** to identify key influencing features.  
- 🎯 Gained insights into how **social & economic factors** impacted survival chances.  

---

## 📊 Visualizations
Some of the insights revealed through this project:
- Survival rate by **gender** (women had a much higher chance).  
- Survival rate by **class** (1st class passengers had higher survival).  
- **Age distribution** of survivors vs non-survivors.  
- Correlation heatmap to identify important features.
