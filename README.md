# üçî Food-Related Insights (Data Visualization with Matplotlib)

This project provides a set of **visualizations about fast food chains, calorie availability, and daily consumption habits** using Python and Matplotlib.  
The code demonstrates how to create multiple charts in a single figure using a 2x2 grid layout.

---

## üìä Visualizations Included

1. **Global Fast-Food Chains (by Outlet Count)**  
   Shows the number of worldwide outlets for McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway, and KFC (real approximations).  

2. **Favorite Fast-Food Chains (Survey Example)**  
   A hypothetical survey showcasing people‚Äôs favorite fast-food brands.  

3. **Daily Calorie Availability by Region**  
   Compares high-income countries with low-income countries (e.g., Nigeria).  

4. **Personal Daily Calorie Consumption (Histogram)**  
   Displays a sample distribution of individual daily calorie intake.

## üñºÔ∏è Example Output

The script generates a **2x2 grid of charts** like this:

- Top-left: Fast-food outlet counts  
- Top-right: Favorite fast-food survey results  
- Bottom-left: Daily calorie availability by region  
- Bottom-right: Histogram of personal calorie consumption
